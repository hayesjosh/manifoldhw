    "    **Within the historical data available for my tagging, the building owners kept up to their lease agreements.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Manifold's business owner partners are contacting Manifold to help them reach lease obligations *more efficiently*. They are not contacting Manifold to help them *initially reach* lease obligations. \n",
    "This assumption has two consequences:\n",
    "   1. I can use the percentage of time that each building is predicted as lease-obligation-satisfied from 9-5 on workdays as a way to gauge my estimator's accuracy.\n",
    "   2. This method places a burden on me, as a researcher, to make sure that I only feed my algorithm data that reflects at least minimal lease-obligation. If I feed in data that is from a business that frequently violates it's lease agreement, then my algorithm will produce unhelpful estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "I chose this assumption over the **inverse assumption**: Buildings are only at lease-obligation once a specified number of sensors are within the temperature range. **I chose not to use the inverse assumption, because under the inverse assumption some buildings (ex. building 37) almost never registered as being lease-satisfied in our historical data. And that seems odd.** Perhaps the average temperature of these buildings never hit temperature because of their structural design. Many buildings have areas with largely diverging temperature regions. For example, many auto-repair stores have a lobby, indoor seating area, office/s, and restroom that will be temperature controlled but also have floor rooms, workshops, and storage rooms that are open to outside air for most of the day. Large hotels will have enough foot traffic that the temperature in the main lobby and entry hallways can vary drastically from those temperatures throughout the rest of the building. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   **The takeaway of my assumption above is this:** \n",
    "       My algorithm is designed to be used on buildings that have already been meeting lease obligations, and their owners want to do so in a more efficient way. My algorithm is not intended for buildings that have not been meeting lease obligations and need assistance in figuring out how to do so. The latter could be created easily enough, but that is not what I am delivering here. \n",

    "The rates of on-target reports vary pretty significantly across sensors, and the distribution of sensor-quality varies across buildings as well. However, between 40-50% on-target seems to be a noteable cut-off for every building. Some of these sensors almost never come into the temperature threshold, and so we could try restricting these sensors from our algorithm in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Take-away from Sensor-Statistic I**: Assuming that these buildings do come to temperature (see note above), not all sensors are equally reliable at reflecting that reality. These visualizations show that we may have more success by assigning each sensor a reliability rating and filtering out undesirable sensors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**But there is a caveat**: Buildings likely do not sit at lease-obligation temperature all the time. If the building is off lease-obligation temperature than we would *want* our sensors to report that. Therefore, here having a 100% success rate is not actually what we want. We should try restricting getSuccessRatio() to only work-hours where we expect that the building is, in fact, at lease-obligation temperature. Then we would *really* be measuring a successful reflection of the building being at temp, rather than just measuring if the sensor report falls within our specified threshold."

That is, the first available time is reported back as our estimation because the building already started within the temperature threshold. This is actually not that helpful, if the building moves out of the temperature threshold before the work day begins. **Ideally, we would want to remain open and skeptical to buildings being outside temperature thresholds closer towards working hours.**  I would move to cut the first few hours of the day off, so that each \"day\" starts at around 4:00AM-5:00AM. At present, the algorithm shuts out any additional input on days that initialize within the temperature range. This is a simpler, and probably worse, approach to the problem. \n",

    "    A better method would be one that address the *basis* that leads the algorithm to return a value of midnight. The basis of this returned value is that many sensors seem to always report within-threshold values regardless of the time of day. These sensors may be quite bias. I would iterate forward by trying to remove these sensors just as I removed the bias-towards-failure sensors. \n",

    "    - One way to vet if sensors are **reliably sensitive** to HVAC influence would be to see how their readings change between hours in which the HVAC system is on and when the HVAC system is off. Making the assumption that HVAC will tend to be on during work-hours and that buildings will be temperature controlled during the middle of the day (after coming into temperature in the morning), we can assume that sensitive sensors should tend towards on-target reports during weekdays between 10:00AM-3:00PM. Sensitive sensors will also tend to fall out of target-range during off hours. **Thus, sensors that have a large amount of difference between *work-hour reports* and *non-work-hour reports* will likely be sensors that are more reliable for determining the impact of each buildings' HVAC system.** \n",
    "    - Because buildings tend to stay at temperature during the week but move out of range on the weekends, we could also compare sensors reports from working hours to their reports on weekends. \n",

    "3. **Verify Building Temperature Trends Throughout The Day**: A good idea would be to make predictions for every time period, to determine if my algorithm thinks the building is at lease obligation or not. Then I would want to see what percentage of the time during work-hours my algorithm determines the building is at temperature. Again, assuming that these buildings are frequently meeting their lease obligations, then I would want to see my algorithm acknowledging that the lease is fulfilled during the majority of work hours and that random drops of lease obligation in the middle of the day are rare. \n",
    "    - Pred2() started to capture that Mondays come up to temp late compared to every other day of the week. This makes sense, given that the building has likely sat over the weekend and places more demands on the HVAC system than other days. Once the temperature is established in the building, it is easier to maintain throughout the week. \n",
    "    - Looking for other logical and defensible patterns such as the one above will help determine if the algorithm is working as expected. For example, we would expect that when viewed throughout the entire week that buildings will stay within acceptable thresholds longer during milder months (April, September) than during harsh months (January, July).
